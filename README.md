# Evil Organ

Play the right music notes and the locker will be yours

## Introduction

This is a little Python program intended to run on a Raspberry Pi device. The 'Evil Organ' program is part of a game designed for youth movement activities. The goal of this game is to key in a specific note sequence on a self-made electronic organ. If the note sequence is correct, a signal is sent to open a locker.
